# Deterministic Optimization Assigment

This program finds the global minimum of the Rosenbrock's function with the Conjugate Gradient method or Levenberg-Marquardt method and shows the number of steps needed for these algorithms to arrive at that minimum

## Files

The deliverable consists on the ```main.c``` program that was used to comipe our program, the ```detlibrary.h``` necessari to run the main file which contains the standard C libraries, the defined macros and the functions needed and ```report```explaining the results accuired. The executable ```deterministic``` is also sent which is ready to use through the terminal and ```Report_steps``` folder where data used in the report is stored.

## Usage

When executing is neceesary to indicate the method wanted for the absolute minimum calculation with the form:

    $./Deterministic [g/l]
    
'g' will use the  Conjugate Gradient method and 'l' Levenberg-Marquardt method
