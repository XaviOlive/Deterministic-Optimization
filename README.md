# Deterministic Optimization Assigment

This program finds the global minimum of the Rosenbrock's function with the Conjugate Gradient method or Levenberg-Marquardt method and shows the number of steps needed for these algorithms to arrive at that minimum

## Files

The project consists on the ```main.c``` program that was used to comipe our program, the ```detlibrary.h``` necessari to run the main file which contains the standard C libraries, the defined macros and the functions needed and ```Report.pdf```explaining the results accuired. The ```Report_steps.zip``` file contains the data solution found.

## Usage

When executing is neceesary to indicate the method wanted for the absolute minimum calculation with the form:

    $./Deterministic [g/l]
    
'g' will use the  Conjugate Gradient method and 'l' Levenberg-Marquardt method.
In the ```Report_steps.zip``` solution for both methods can be found in two ```.txt```files.
